Possible status values are:
pending - entrant to pending part of mempool
stuck - entrant to queued part of mempool (nonce gap with existing pending tx)
confirmed - added to block with successful tx execution
failed - added to block with failed tx execution
cancel - replaced by new tx with same from/nonce (node requires 10% increase in gasPrice)
speedup - replaced by new tx with same from/nonce/to/value/input (node requires 10% increase in gasPrice)
dropped - previously pending tx not seen in mempool for 30 min (this status may not be reliable)
