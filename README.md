# blockchain-fees-simulator

## Introduction

Current 1st Price Auction of transactions fees to be included a in a block in Ethereum is leading to price spikes under congestion scenarios [3]:

> Ethereumâ€™s existing gas prices respond to the relatively limited number of transactions that one can facilitate using a single block. Miners, in such a scenario, can choose the highest-priced transactions as their priority, so the result is an increase in effective gas prices.

## Description

A simulation tool for blockchain fees, aka gas market in Ethereum-type blockchains.

We want to compare at least the following strategies:

 - Bitcoin/Ethereum standard 1st Price Auction.
 - Ethereum EIP-1599, floating minimum gas-price, currently implemented in the Celo Blockchain.
 - Experimental Dutch-auction strategies.
 
We plan to use syntethic data and also empiric registered data from transaction mempool, such as published by Blocknative [0].
